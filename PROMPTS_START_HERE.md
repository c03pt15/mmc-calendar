Quick path:

- Open PROMPTS_NEW_PROJECT.md and paste the “Example full prompt” with your app/repo names.
- When I return the app, add .env from the values in Supabase and run npm install/dev.
- Use PROMPTS_DB_SCHEMA.md to generate your SQL, seeds, RLS, and triggers; run in Supabase.
- Use PROMPTS_DEPLOYMENT.md to wire GitHub (main branch) and deploy on Vercel with envs set for Production and Preview.
